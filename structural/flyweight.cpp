// Explanation:
// Character (Flyweight): This class stores intrinsic state (the character's symbol, font, and size) that is shared across multiple instances. The extrinsic state (the position where the character is displayed) is passed when needed.
// CharacterFactory (Flyweight Factory): Manages a pool of Character flyweights. It ensures that if a character with the same intrinsic state (e.g., same symbol, font, and size) is requested, an existing flyweight is reused instead of creating a new one.
// Client: The client requests flyweights from the factory and supplies extrinsic state (position) when displaying characters.
// Use Case:
// You would use the Flyweight Pattern when:
// 
// You need to create a large number of similar objects (e.g., characters in a document, graphical objects in a game).
// You want to reduce memory usage by sharing common data between objects.
// You can separate the object's intrinsic state (shared data) from its extrinsic state (context-specific data).
// Advantages:
// Memory Efficiency: The flyweight pattern reduces memory usage by sharing objects that have common intrinsic state.
// Performance: It can improve performance in systems that would otherwise create a large number of similar objects.
// Extensibility: You can easily add new flyweights or change their extrinsic state without modifying the shared objects.
// Disadvantages:
// Complexity: Introducing shared objects and separating intrinsic/extrinsic state can make the code more complicated.
// Synchronization Issues: In multithreaded environments, managing shared flyweights might require synchronization to ensure thread safety.
