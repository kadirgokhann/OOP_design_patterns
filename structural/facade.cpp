// Explanation:
// AudioSystem, VideoSystem, StorageSystem (Subsystems): These are the complex subsystems that handle different aspects of multimedia playback. They have their own specific interfaces that would normally require detailed knowledge to use.
// MediaFacade (Facade): The Facade class simplifies the interaction with the subsystems. It provides a single method to play media (playMedia) and stop it (stopMedia), hiding the complexity of mounting drives, loading files, and playing audio/video.
// Client: The client interacts only with the MediaFacade, without needing to know about the underlying systems.
// Use Case:
// You would use the Facade Pattern when:
// 
// You have a complex system with multiple subsystems that clients need to interact with.
// You want to provide a simpler, unified interface to reduce the complexity for clients.
// You want to decouple the client from the subsystems to allow future changes without affecting the client.
// Advantages:
// Simplifies Client Code: The client interacts with a simpler interface instead of dealing with multiple subsystems.
// Decouples Client from Subsystems: The client doesn't need to know how the subsystems work, making it easier to modify or replace them without impacting the client.
// Improves Code Readability: By hiding the complex interactions, it makes the code easier to read and maintain.
// Disadvantages:
// Limited Control: The facade may hide too much functionality, limiting the clientâ€™s control over the subsystems.
// Not for All Use Cases: If the client needs fine-grained control over the subsystems, the Facade Pattern might not be the best fit.
