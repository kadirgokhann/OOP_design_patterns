This concludes the five Creational Design Patterns. Here’s a recap:

Singleton – Ensures a class has only one instance.
Factory Method – Creates objects, but allows subclasses to determine the specific class to instantiate.
Abstract Factory – Provides an interface to create families of related objects.
Builder – Builds a complex object step by step.
Prototype – Creates new objects by copying existing objects (prototypes)
